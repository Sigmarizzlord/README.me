    <p> Swing : To swing, pull your arm back and keep your non dominant arm up. Engage your back and then move your elbow in a circular way with your shoulder and swing your <strong> Non dominant </strong> arm down and then follow up by swinging your dominant arm down and ending with your dominant arm beside you body. Do not swing across to avoid injury. </p>
  <h1>Positions</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball#Strategy" target="_blank"></a> Positions : The person in the left front of the court is the outside hitter or outside. The person in the middle front is the middle blocker/hitter or middle. The person on the right is the oppo or opposite hitter. The setter ideally always gets the 2nd touch of the ball and sets the front row hitters. In the back, there is the libero, the primary defense for the back row, and the ds or defensive specialist who recieves balls in the back row as their primary roles. There will usually be 2 outside hitters on each side of the court, 1 middle , 1 oppo, 1 lib, and 1 ds. This combines for a total of 6 players on each side of the court.

     <p>If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
     <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

     <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
