    <p> Swing : To swing, pull your arm back and keep your non dominant arm up. Engage your back and then move your elbow in a circular way with your shoulder and swing your <strong> Non dominant </strong> arm down and then follow up by swinging your dominant arm down and ending with your dominant arm beside you body. Do not swing across to avoid injury. </p>
  <h1>Positions</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball#Strategy" target="_blank"> Positions</a>: The person in the left front of the court is the outside hitter or outside. The person in the middle front is the middle blocker/hitter or middle. The person on the right is the oppo or opposite hitter. The setter ideally always gets the 2nd touch of the ball and sets the front row hitters. In the back, there is the libero, the primary defense for the back row, and the ds or defensive specialist who recieves balls in the back row as their primary roles. There will usually be 2 outside hitters on each side of the court, 1 middle , 1 oppo, 1 lib, and 1 ds. This combines for a total of 6 players on each side of the court.
     <h2>How to recieve</h2>

     <p> have your legs in defensive position, knees slightly bent and if in front row, hands in a setting position and in back row, arms ready to come together and recieve. Legs should be a little over shouler width apart and depending on positioning, either left or right leg will go slightly in front.

     <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
